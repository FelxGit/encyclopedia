world.

<h3>Welcome to the amazing world of animals!</h3>
    
From the frozen poles to the sunless depths of soceans, from highest mountains to arid deserts every region of our planets has been colonized by animals.
Animals live in interactive partnership with other species with their physical. Without animals, humans could not survive. A scientific understanding of the animal world increases, so does the appreciation of the intimate relationship between humas and animals, and of the need to conserve the rich diversity of the earth.
The Family Encyclopedia of Animals looks at five main groups of animals: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fish and Amphibians, and Invertebrates. Mammals are the smallest group, but the mammals include the largest animal, the blue whale. Easily the biggest group, with myriads of individual animals in millions of species, are the invertebrates, the group that includes insects as well as crustaceas and arachnids.
